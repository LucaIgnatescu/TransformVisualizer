1. Let user input a matrix
  * Show basis vectors
  * Animate change from one coordinate system to another
2. Give 2d option which just flattens in xy plane - (setmatrix to initial matrix)
3. Maybe draw planes but see if I can do that or not...
4. Draw to rotate !important
5. w and s to zoom in/out
6. Try to find a way to add text

This is turning into poor man's geogebra basically

Introduce a series of lessons:
* plot vectors and show what they look like (coordiantes to points)
  * let user introduce points and see how they form
* try to implement planes and show how those are determined by an ecuation
* try to talk about linear systems if I manage to implement planes
* talk about linear transformations
  * show the basis vectors
  * implement a button that animates a linear transformation

## Todo
- [x] Implement a plane through xyz
- [x] Implement lines through 2 points
- [x] Implement normal to plane
- [ ] Implement shading and materials ( later )
